# Predicting-booking-rate-for-Airbnb-listings-using-Ensemble-models-

This project is a part of a data mining contest held in class. We are predicting the popularity of an Airbnb. 
First we cleaned all the data, these scripts can be found as R files. 
Then we applied various algorithms, however boosting worked the best.
The entire project was done in R.
